| max_temp | integer | optional | `95` | Maximum temperature HA can set. |
| cloud_svc | string | optional | `lennox` | Cloud service selection - use `lennox` or `airease` | 

### Multiple zones or systems
Add additional entries under climate for each additional system or zone.

    username: !secret cloudapi_username
    password: !secret cloudapi_password
    system: 0 
    zone: 0 
    min_temp: 55
    max_temp: 90
    cloud_svc: lennox
  - platform: myicomfort
    name: ManCave
    username: !secret cloudapi_username
    password: !secret cloudapi_password
    system: 0 
    zone: 1 
    min_temp: 45
    max_temp: 75
    cloud_svc: lennox
  - platform: myicomfort
    name: Upstairs
    username: !secret cloudapi_username
    password: !secret cloudapi_password

    zone: 0 
    min_temp: 65
    max_temp: 80
    cloud_svc: airease
```

# Notes

### Humidity 
The humidity is exposed to HA as an attribute of the climate entity but since the device doesn't support set_humdity, most of the thermostat cards won't display it. The template platform can be used to capture the humidity and make it accessible as a sensor. You can use the [Simple Thermostat card](https://github.com/nervetattoo/simple-thermostat) to add the sensor to a thermostat card.

Below is a an example to expose the current humidity as a sensor. The climate device is named 'lennox' and the resulting sensor is 'lennox_humidity'.
```yaml
template:
  - sensor:
    - name: lennox_humidity
      unit_of_measurement: '%'
      state: '{{ states.climate.lennox.attributes.current_humidity | float }}'
```

### HA 0.96 to 2021.4 
There were minor changes to the climate platform between 0.96 and 2021.4. You can read thru release notes in this repository to find a version that works for you.

### HA 0.95 or older
If for some reason you are still running HA 0.95 or older, you can still integrate with your thermostat. You just need to grab one of the older code sets from here: https://github.com/thevoltagesource/LennoxiComfort-archive
